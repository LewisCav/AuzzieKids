                    After years of supporting various well known kids charities, Aussie Kidz Charity was started
                    <br> in early 2000 by a group of individuals disheartened by watching an increasing percentage
                    <br> by watching an increasing percentage of donations being used to cover overheads instead of
                    <br> instead of going to the ones who need it most, the Kids.
                    <br> We are focusing on gaining support and donations through the generosity of Directors, individuals, 
                    <br> corporations, estate trusts and through various yearly fund raising activities.

                    Countless special kids in Australia are without proper care or
                    <br> equipment to help them with their unique needs. These needed
                    <br> life changing equipment can be very expensive and often times
                    <br> parents are unable to afford them. This is where we come in.
                    <br> Aussie Kidz Charity is dedicated to giving these kids 
                    <br> the support they need so they too can enjoy being a kid. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    However we too are in need of support by receiving donations 
                    <br> from incredible, charitable people who are willing to donate to
                    <br> give special needs kids what they need to live comfortably.
